# Deep-learning-1-projects--M2-Data-Science-T-l-com-
Labs I worked on during the Deep Learning-I course at Télécom Paris during my M2 in Data Sciences at Institut Polytechnique de Paris

Content:
- 1 lab implementing, training, testing an MLP from scratch in python
- 1 lab implementing, training,testing an MLP using PyTorch
- 1 lab implementing,training, testing an RNN with LSTM cells through KERAS on the IMDb database for sentiment analysis. Traineda language model and used word embedding. 
- 1 lab implementing, training a language model adapted to music based on Bach cello suites in order to then generate sequences based on an input sequence.Implemented in KERAS using Many-to-one RNN with LSTM cells. 

To come:
- 2 labs on Convolutional Neural Networks implemented both in Keras and Tensorflow 2
